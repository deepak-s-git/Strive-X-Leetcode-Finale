# 📘 Phase 1 — Chapter 2: Patterns

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Patterns**, where we focus on building strong fundamentals in **nested loops**, **logic visualization**, and **structured thinking**.  
Pattern problems are the perfect way to understand how loops work together and how output shapes depend on logic.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this chapter, you’ll learn:

- How **nested loops** work in C++
- How to control **rows** and **columns** effectively
- The use of **spaces, symbols, and numbers** to form various patterns
- Logical thinking and step-by-step construction of output shapes
- The foundation for **time and space analysis** through repeated operations

## 🧩 Pattern Categories Covered

| Category | Description | Example Pattern |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **1. Basic Square & Triangle Patterns** | Simple structures to understand nested loops | `****`<br>`***`<br>`**`<br>`*` |
| **2. Number-Based Patterns** | Patterns using incremental or repeated numbers | `1`<br>`1 2`<br>`1 2 3` |
| **3. Inverted & Mirrored Patterns** | Learn how spacing and symmetry work | `   *`<br>`  ***`<br>` *****` |
| **4. Diamond Patterns** | Combining increasing and decreasing loops | Diamond or hourglass shapes |
| **5. Binary (0/1) Patterns** | Logic-based alternating patterns | `1`, `0`, `10`, `01` |
| **6. Alphabet Patterns** | Using ASCII and characters to form shapes | `A`, `A B`, `A B C`, etc. |
| **7. Complex Symmetric Patterns** | Merging concepts (numbers, spaces, symmetry) | Palindromic number/letter pyramids |
